## General comments

Great work and very clean code so far.
I added a few comments but they're mostly minor suggestions.
Most of the "changes" I made we actually just from prettier - please make sure your prettier extension is functioning so this doesn't keep happening.
I also re-arranged some imports to make them easier to manage.
